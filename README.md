# ICF ATOM Delegation

This repository summarizes the Interchain Foundation's approach to delegating
its ATOMs.

## Overview

The Interchain Foundation (ICF) takes a conservative approach to all of its activity.
As outlined in a [recent blog
post](https://blog.cosmos.network/open-decentralized-networks-87e6097536a3), 
the success of the network depends
fundamentally on the actions of the wider community. This means the community of ATOM holders
is responsible for ensuring the network is sufficiently decentralized and that
community interests are adequately represented by the validator set.

That said, as a significant stake holder in the Cosmos Network, the ICF is
interested, like other significant stake holders, in the success of the network,
which includes the decentralization of its validator set.

To this extent, the ICF intends to delegate some of its ATOMs at some times in a way that
encourages a healthy validator set.

As of April 4, 2019, 5 validators control one third of the stake and 13 control two
thirds (see the `cmd/stake-dist` tool). 

ATOM holders are *strongly encouraged* to diversify their delegations to
improve the decentralization of the validator set.

## Delegations

See the [delegations directory](delegations) for documentation on particular delegation
decisions by the ICF.

## Disclaimer

The ICF reserves the right to change its delegations at any time. It may withdraw delegations
from some or all of the validators it has delegated to and/or redelegate to specific validators at any point 
in time without any reason. Further, no validator may assert any claims against the ICF to delegate 
ATOMs to them. The ICF is under no obligation to delegate its ATOMs.

This document is for information purposes only with regards to the ICF's
intention and is not binding in any way.
