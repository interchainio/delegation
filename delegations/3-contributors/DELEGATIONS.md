# Round 3 - Delegating to Contributors

As part of it’s ongoing efforts to grow the Cosmos ecosystem, the ICF is
delegating ATOMs to validators making significant contributions to the larger
Cosmos community.

We issued a [call](https://twitter.com/interchain_io/status/1137103291769327617) for delegation applications from June 7-June 17, 2019, and 46
validators applied.  

The main criteria considered is community contributions and ecosystem
involvement. We want to support validators that are contributing, giving back
to, and engaging in the greater Cosmos community. Such contributions may
include: creating a block explorer, active engagement in the governance process,
publishing articles and guides, holding meetups and events, contributing open
source code, etc.  Of particular interest are contributions of open source code
and local efforts to build Cosmos communities.

We also took into account commission rates, which should not be unreasonable,
and geographic diversity, which greatly facilitates the network’s architectural
and political fault tolerance.
Applications were reviewed by a team of 6 people and scored out of 16 points. 

- Applications which received a score of 13 (inclusive) and above received 300,000 Atoms for delegation. 
- Applications which received a score of 8 (inclusive) to 13 received 100,000 Atoms for delegation.
- Applications which received a score below 8 received 33,000 Atoms for delegation. 

The ICF  encourages a diverse ecosystem; all validators who applied received
some delegation. The only exception to the rules above was Sikka. If you’ve been
paying attention, you know very well why they were considered an exception.
Nonetheless, in their application, they did request some delegation from the ICF
as a “token of recognition”.  So the ICF delegated an encoded symbolic amount to
Sikka. Can you decode it?

While we asked questions on the application about validator security setups,
after consideration, we did not use this self-reported information as part of
the evaluation process as we cannot verify these claims and want to focus most
on community contributions. 

That said, the importance of mature security setups cannot be overstated, and we
strongly encourage validators to continue to improve their infrastructure and
security maturity. In order to further  support this, Jessy Irwin, the Head of
Security at All in Bits, will be holding a biweekly Cosmos security office hours
to  introduce a security maturity model that was developed to help validators
measure their defenses against different classes of attackers with different
capabilities and skill sets.

Please join the office hours, which begin Wednesday August 14 at 8am PST and
will happen biweekly, by signing up

The ICF is continuing its efforts to support a healthy ecosystem and encourage a
balanced and dynamic validator set capable of hosting the next generation of
digital infrastructure. We look forward to ongoing and evolving contributions by
validators.

# Disclaimer

The ICF reserves the right to change its delegations at any time. It may
withdraw delegations from some or all of the validators it has delegated to
and/or redelegate to specific validators at any point in time without any
reason. Further, no validator may assert any claims against the ICF to delegate
ATOMs to them. The ICF is under no obligation to delegate its ATOMs. Delegation
from the ICF does not constitute an endorsement.

**Note:** A final delegation was made on August 30 to an applicant who submitted an incorrect address in the application form, this was corrected and the delegation was completed.
