# Round 3 - Delegating to Contributors

**Calling all Cosmos validators! Tell us how you are taking part in the Cosmos ecosystem.** 

The Interchain Foundation (ICF) values all members of the Cosmos ecosystem and aims to support members who are giving back to the ecosystem at large. 

One way the ICF will do this is by delegating ATOMs to validators that are contributing to the greater Cosmos community. Thus, the ICF is making a call for applications from Cosmos validators for delegation of ICF ATOMs. 

We want to hear from validators about how you are contributing to the Cosmos ecosystem. 

Contributions could include (but are not limited to): 

- Creating a block explorer for the community to use
- Active engagement in the governance process
- Publishing articles about Cosmos (examples: *Governance Proposal Overviews*, *How To Delegate Your ATOMs* etc)
- Holding Cosmos meetups and community events
- Contributing open source code

And the list goes on! 

The ICF will accept applications from validators from Friday June 7-Monday June 17, 2019. We will review the applications and delegate to the selected validators who are actively contributing and giving back to the ecosystem at large. 

To apply, please submit an application here:

*The ICF reserves the right to change its delegations at any time. It may withdraw delegations from some or all of the validators it has delegated to and/or re-delegate to specific validators at any point in time without any reason. Further, no validator may assert any claims against the ICF to delegate ATOMs to them. The ICF is under no obligation to delegate its ATOMs and the delegation of its ATOMs is at the sole discretion of the ICF. Delegation from the ICF does not constitute an endorsement.*
